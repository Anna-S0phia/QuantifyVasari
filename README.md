# Quantifying Vasari

## Authorship Verification of Lives

### Repository of EPFL History and the Digital course project (Spring 2021)

Was Vasari the author of the Lives is the question addressed while using computational methods. 

The second edition of the Lives published in 1568 is a huge investigation work that gathers a great amount of information about the lives of who Vasari considered the best artists at that time. If many of them were Florentin, they were also past artists and the work would have required investigating and comparing several sources of information. Then the nature and the workload of this investigation naturally questions the real process of writing: was Vasari the only one to write it?

In her essay “Reconsidering the Authorship of the 'Lives'” (2015), the Italian scholar Eliana Carrara is claiming that the theses of “kollektive Autorschaft” (Carrara (2015), p. 53) which was put forward and prevailed by some Anglo-Saxon historians, arose from “the difficulty that non-Italian-speaking scholars had in fully understanding the introductory sections of the Lives” which led to the highly controversial conclusion that several Florentine men connected to the Accademia Fiorentina were contributing to the Lives. Following Carrara, it would be essential for any serious exploration to pay the utmost attention to precisely the words and expressions that Vasari had used since his earliest letters. 

Even though this approach is predestined for a quantitative method, our further research failed to identify any attempt at quantitative authorship verification on Vasari’s Lives.
